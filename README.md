# Software_Project_Final

To do:
spkmeans.c:
1. need to add support in CSV files
2. spk not working - inaccurate numbers in Jacobi Algorithm and heuristic eigenvalues - !!! if k=1 in the end of this algorithm Error of type 2!!!
3. need to add validation that the matrix we get for Jacobi Algorithm is symmetric (?)


example for Jacobi matrix:
{{1.9997,1.2698,0.7305,0.0000},
{0.7071,-0.0065,-0.0116,0.7070},
{0.0009,0.7070,0.7070,0.0172},
{-0.0009,-0.7072,0.7070,0.0060},
{-0.7071,-0.0048,-0.0116,0.7070}}
